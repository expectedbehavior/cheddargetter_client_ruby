= Cheddar Getter API Client for Ruby

This is a Ruby wrapper for the CheddarGetter[http://cheddargetter.com] API.  
It allows you to interface with the Cheddar Getter API using simple calls, i.e.:

    client = CheddarGetter::Client.new(:product_code => "YOUR_PRODUCT_CODE",
                                       :username => "your.username@example.com",
                                       :password => "your.password")

    client.new_customer(
      :code      => 'EXAMPLE_CUSTOMER',
      :firstName => 'Example',
      :lastName  => 'Customer',
      :email     => 'example_customer@example.com',
      :subscription => {
        :planCode     => 'THE_PLAN_CODE',
        :ccFirstName  => 'Example',
        :ccLastName   => 'Customer',
        :ccNumber     => '4111111111111111',
        :ccExpiration => '04/2011',
        :ccZip        => '90210'
      }
    )

See the `example` directory for more usage examples. 
It is modeled directly after cheddargetter-client-php[https://github.com/marcguyer/cheddargetter-client-php], the official PHP library, with a number of ruby-isms to make life easier.
